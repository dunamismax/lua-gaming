## Use This Template

This repository serves as a GitHub template, providing game developers with a robust foundation for building Lua-based games across multiple frameworks. Rather than cloning, you can create your own repository instance with all essential infrastructure and demo games pre-configured.

**To get started:**

1. Click the green **"Use this template"** button at the top right of this repository
2. Choose "Create a new repository"
3. Name your repository and set it to public or private
4. Click "Create repository from template"

This will create a new repository in your GitHub account with all the code, structure, and configuration files needed to start building games immediately using the complete Lua gaming stack.

**Advantages of using the template:**

- Establishes a clean git history beginning with your initial commit
- Configures your repository as the primary origin (not a fork)
- Enables complete customization of repository name and description
- Provides full ownership and administrative control of the codebase

## Shared Libraries Usage

The monorepo provides battle-tested libraries for common game development patterns:

```lua
-- Animation and tweening
local tween = require("../../../shared/libs/tween")
local playerTween = tween.new(1, player, {x = 200}, 'outBounce')

-- Utility functions
local lume = require("../../../shared/libs/lume")
local distance = lume.distance(x1, y1, x2, y2)

-- Math utilities
local mathutils = require("../../../shared/utils/math")
local clamped = mathutils.clamp(value, 0, 100)

-- Collision detection
local collision = require("../../../shared/utils/collision")
if collision.rectRect(player.x, player.y, 32, 32, enemy.x, enemy.y, 32, 32) then
    -- Handle collision
end

-- Game state management
local gamestate = require("../../../shared/utils/gamestate")
gamestate.switch("menu")
```
